abstract={Discovery of Weyl semimetals has revived interest in Weyl fermions which has not been observed in high energy experiments. It now becomes possible to study, in solids, their exotic properties. Extensive photoemission spectroscopy and electrical resistivity experiments have been carried out. However, many other properties remain unexplored. Here we show the thermoelectric signature of the chiral anomaly of Weyl fermions in Cd3As2 under a magnetic field. We observe a strong quadratic suppression of the thermopower when the magnetic field is parallel to the temperature gradient. The quadratic coefficient is nearly twice of that for the electrical conductivity. The thermopower reverses its sign in high fields. We show that all these intriguing observations can be understood in terms of the chiral anomaly of Weyl fermions. Our results reveal the anomalous thermoelectric property of Weyl fermions and provide insight into the chiral anomaly.},

@article{Bustarret2006,
	abstract = {Superconductivity has turned up in some unlikely materials such as diamond. But it has been disappointingly absent in silicon. The conductivity of silicon, the archetypal semiconductor, can be varied by many orders of magnitude by 'doping' ---adding traces of other elements. Doping with boron atoms, for example, turns the semiconductor into a metal, so the challenge is to squeeze in even more boron so that a current can flow without resistance. That goal has now been achieved, using a technique called gas immersion laser doping. In the process, silicon is made molten and solidified repeatedly while boron atoms diffuse into the material at each cycle. Doped in this way, with a boron concentration of several per cent, silicon becomes superconducting below 0.35 K.},

ABSTRACT = {Emergent electronic phenomena in iron-based superconductors have been at the forefront of condensed matter physics for more than a decade. Much has been learned about the origins and intertwined roles of ordered phases, including nematicity, magnetism, and superconductivity, in this fascinating class of materials. In recent years, focus has been centered on the peculiar and highly unusual properties of FeSe and its close cousins. This family of materials has attracted considerable attention due to the discovery of unexpected superconducting gap structures, a wide range of superconducting critical temperatures, and evidence for nontrivial band topology, including associated spin-helical surface states and vortex-induced Majorana bound states. Here, we review superconductivity in iron chalcogenide superconductors, including bulk FeSe, doped bulk FeSe, FeTe1âˆ’xSex, intercalated FeSe materials, and monolayer FeSe and FeTe1âˆ’xSex on SrTiO3. We focus on the superconducting properties, including a survey of the relevant experimental studies, and a discussion of the different proposed theoretical pairing scenarios. In the last part of the paper, we review the growing recent evidence for nontrivial topological effects in FeSe-related materials, focusing again on interesting implications for superconductivity.},

	Abstract = {A three-dimensional (3D) Dirac semimetal (SM) is the 3D analogue of graphene having linear energy dispersion around Fermi points. Owing to the nontrivial topology of electronic wave functions, the 3D Dirac SM shows nontrivial physical properties and hosts various exotic quantum states such as Weyl SMs and topological insulators under proper external conditions. There are several kinds of Dirac SMs proposed theoretically and partly confirmed experimentally, but its unified picture is still missing. Here we propose a general framework to classify stable 3D Dirac SMs in systems having the time-reversal, inversion and uniaxial rotational symmetries. We show that there are two distinct classes of 3D Dirac SMs. In one class, the Dirac SM possesses a single Dirac point (DP) at a time-reversal invariant momentum on the rotation axis. Whereas the other class of Dirac SMs have a pair of DPs created by band inversion, and carry a quantized topological invariant.},

	Abstract = {Although bulk allotropes of carbon and boron differ greatly, small clusters of these elements show remarkable similarities. Boron analogs of two-dimensional carbon allotropes such as graphene have been predicted. Now Mannix et al. report the formation of two-dimensional boron by depositing the elemental boron onto a silver surface under ultrahigh-vacuum conditions (see the Perspective by Sachdev). The graphene-like structure was buckled, weakly bonded to the substrate, and metallic.Science, this issue p. 1513; see also p. 1468At the atomic-cluster scale, pure boron is markedly similar to carbon, forming simple planar molecules and cage-like fullerenes. Theoretical studies predict that two-dimensional (2D) boron sheets will adopt an atomic configuration similar to that of boron atomic clusters. We synthesized atomically thin, crystalline 2D boron sheets (i.e., borophene) on silver surfaces under ultrahigh-vacuum conditions. Atomic-scale characterization, supported by theoretical calculations, revealed structures reminiscent of fused boron clusters with multiple scales of anisotropic, out-of-plane buckling. Unlike bulk boron allotropes, borophene shows metallic characteristics that are consistent with predictions of a highly anisotropic, 2D metal.},

@article{Feng2016,
	Abstract = {A variety of two-dimensional materials have been reported in recent years, yet single-element systems such as graphene and black phosphorus have remained rare. Boron analogues have been predicted, as boron atoms possess a short covalent radius and the flexibility to adopt sp2 hybridization, features that favour the formation of two-dimensional allotropes, and one example of such a borophene material has been reported recently. Here, we present a parallel experimental work showing that two-dimensional boron sheets can be grown epitaxially on a Ag(111) substrate. Two types of boron sheet, a β12 sheet and a χ3 sheet, both exhibiting a triangular lattice but with different arrangements of periodic holes, are observed by scanning tunnelling microscopy. Density functional theory simulations agree well with experiments, and indicate that both sheets are planar without obvious vertical undulations. The boron sheets are quite inert to oxidization and interact only weakly with their substrate. We envisage that such boron sheets may find applications in electronic devices in the future.},

	Abstract = {The topological aspects of electrons in solids can emerge in real materials, as represented by topological insulators. In theory, they show a variety of new magneto-electric phenomena, and especially the ones hosting superconductivity are strongly desired as candidates for topological superconductors. While efforts have been made to develop possible topological superconductors by introducing carriers into topological insulators, those exhibiting indisputable superconductivity free from inhomogeneity are very few. Here we report on the observation of topologically protected surface states in a centrosymmetric layered superconductor, β-PdBi2, by utilizing spin- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. Besides the bulk bands, several surface bands are clearly observed with symmetrically allowed in-plane spin polarizations, some of which crossing the Fermi level. These surface states are precisely evaluated to be topological, based on the Z2 invariant analysis in analogy to three-dimensional strong topological insulators. β-PdBi2 may offer a solid stage to investigate the topological aspect in the superconducting condensate.},

When the thickness of the quantum well is varied, the electronic state changes from a normal to an {\textquotedblleft}inverted{\textquotedblright} type at a critical thickness dc. We show that this transition is a topological quantum phase transition between a conventional insulating phase and a phase exhibiting the QSH effect with a single pair of helical edge states. We also discuss methods for experimental detection of the QSH effect.},

While the degeneracy points in Weyl semimetals are robust against any perturbation that preserves translational symmetry, nodal lines require protection by additional crystalline symmetries such as mirror reflection. Here we report, based on a systematic theoretical study and a detailed experimental characterization, the existence of topological nodal-line states in the non-centrosymmetric compound PbTaSe2 with strong spin-orbit coupling. Remarkably, the spin-orbit nodal lines in PbTaSe2 are not only protected by the reflection symmetry but also characterized by an integer topological invariant. Our detailed angle-resolved photoemission measurements, first-principles simulations and theoretical topological analysis illustrate the physical mechanism underlying the formation of the topological nodal-line states and associated surface states for the first time, thus paving the way towards exploring the exotic properties of the topological nodal-line fermions in condensed matter systems.},

	Abstract = {Topological superconductors are an intriguing and elusive quantum phase, characterized by topologically protected gapless surface/edge states residing in a bulk superconducting gap, which hosts Majorana fermions. Unfortunately, all currently known topological superconductors have a very low transition temperature, limiting experimental measurements of Majorana fermions. Here we discover the existence of a topological Dirac--nodal-line state in a well-known conventional high-temperature superconductor, MgB2. First-principles calculations show that the Dirac--nodal-line structure exhibits a unique one-dimensional dispersive Dirac--nodal line, protected by both spatial-inversion and time-reversal symmetry, which connects the electron and hole Dirac states. Most importantly, we show that the topological superconducting phase can be realized with a conventional s-wave superconducting gap, evidenced by the topological edge mode of the MgB2 thin films showing chiral edge states. Our discovery may enable the experimental measurement of Majorana fermions at high temperature.},

abstract  = {Superconductors with a nontrivial band structure are promising to realize a topological superconducting state. Herein{,} we report the presence of a topological phase in a well-known superconductor{,} NaAlSi. Our first-principles computations show that NaAlSi naturally possesses four nodal lines in the kz = 0 and kz = π planes and hosts clear drumhead surface states. Comparing with those identified in other superconductors{,} the nodal line band structure of NaAlSi can more favor experimental detection on considering that: (1) it possesses four nodal lines in total in the system; (2) all the nodal lines appear slightly below the Fermi level; (3) the nodal lines do not coexist with other fermions or extraneous bands. Our findings indicate that NaAlSi is an excellent material platform to investigate the entanglement of superconducting and topological nodal line states.}

	Abstract = {Transition metal dichalcogenides have attracted research interest over the last few decades due to their interesting structural chemistry, unusual electronic properties, rich intercalation chemistry and wide spectrum of potential applications. Despite the fact that the majority of related research focuses on semiconducting transition-metal dichalcogenides (for example, MoS2), recently discovered unexpected properties of WTe2 are provoking strong interest in semimetallic transition metal dichalcogenides featuring large magnetoresistance, pressure-driven superconductivity and Weyl semimetal states. We investigate the sister compound of WTe2, MoTe2, predicted to be a Weyl semimetal and a quantum spin Hall insulator in bulk and monolayer form, respectively. We find that bulk MoTe2 exhibits superconductivity with a transition temperature of 0.10 K. Application of external pressure dramatically enhances the transition temperature up to maximum value of 8.2 K at 11.7 GPa. The observed dome-shaped superconductivity phase diagram provides insights into the interplay between superconductivity and topological physics.},

The layered material TaIrTe4 is a newly predicted time-reversal invariant type II Weyl semimetal with the minimum number of Weyl points. Here, we report the discovery of surface superconductivity in Weyl semimetal TaIrTe4. Our scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy (STM/STS) visualizes Fermi arc surface states of TaIrTe4 that are consistent with the previous angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy results. By a systematic study based on STS at ultralow temperature, we observe uniform superconducting gaps on the sample surface. The superconductivity is further confirmed by electrical transport measurements at ultralow temperature, with an onset transition temperature (Tc) up to 1.54 K being observed. The normalized upper critical field h*(T/Tc) behavior and the stability of the superconductivity against the ferromagnet indicate that the discovered superconductivity is unconventional with the p-wave pairing. The systematic STS, and thickness- and angular-dependent transport measurements reveal that the detected superconductivity is quasi-1D and occurs in the surface states. The discovery of the surface superconductivity in TaIrTe4 provides a new novel platform to explore topological superconductivity and Majorana modes.},

Boron analogs of two-dimensional carbon allotropes such as graphene have been predicted. Now Mannix et al. report the formation of two-dimensional boron by depositing the elemental boron onto a silver surface under ultrahigh-vacuum conditions (see the Perspective by Sachdev). The graphene-like structure was buckled, weakly bonded to the substrate, and metallic.Science, this issue p. 1513; see also p. 1468At the atomic-cluster scale, pure boron is markedly similar to carbon, forming simple planar molecules and cage-like fullerenes. Theoretical studies predict that two-dimensional (2D) boron sheets will adopt an atomic configuration similar to that of boron atomic clusters. We synthesized atomically thin, crystalline 2D boron sheets (i.e., borophene) on silver surfaces under ultrahigh-vacuum conditions. Atomic-scale characterization, supported by theoretical calculations, revealed structures reminiscent of fused boron clusters with multiple scales of anisotropic, out-of-plane buckling. Unlike bulk boron allotropes, borophene shows metallic characteristics that are consistent with predictions of a highly anisotropic, 2D metal.},

@article{Feng2016,
	Abstract = {A variety of two-dimensional materials have been reported in recent years, yet single-element systems such as graphene and black phosphorus have remained rare. Boron analogues have been predicted, as boron atoms possess a short covalent radius and the flexibility to adopt sp2 hybridization, features that favour the formation of two-dimensional allotropes, and one example of such a borophene material has been reported recently. Here, we present a parallel experimental work showing that two-dimensional boron sheets can be grown epitaxially on a Ag(111) substrate. Two types of boron sheet, a β12 sheet and a χ3 sheet, both exhibiting a triangular lattice but with different arrangements of periodic holes, are observed by scanning tunnelling microscopy. Density functional theory simulations agree well with experiments, and indicate that both sheets are planar without obvious vertical undulations. The boron sheets are quite inert to oxidization and interact only weakly with their substrate. We envisage that such boron sheets may find applications in electronic devices in the future.},

    abstract = "{Resonance is a ubiquitous phenomenon observed in a wide range of physical systems. Recently, with the Fano resonance exerting remarkable potential for optical, acoustic, atomic, and electronic applications, it is vital to control and even dynamically reconfigure the resonance line shape and bandwidth, in addition to its frequency. In this work, we introduce a parity-time-reciprocal scaling (PTX)-symmetric structure, which can offer a promising avenue for tailoring the resonance frequency and line shape of electronic circuits. We have theoretically studied the resonance behavior of such a PTX-symmetric electronic system, particularly for dependencies of resonant peaks and line-shapes on the non-Hermiticity, coupling coefficient, and the scaling coefficient introduced by the reciprocal scaling (X) transformation. Our results demonstrate that, at resonance frequencies, a transition between Fano and Lorentzian line-shapes is possible with a specific reciprocal scaling rule applied to lumped-element circuits.}",
